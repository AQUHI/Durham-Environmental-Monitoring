# Hot Durham Project Cleanup Summary

**Date:** May 25, 2025

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### Archived Files
The following files have been moved to the archive directory:

1. **Combined File** (Primary Target):
   - ✅ Moved `/src/data_collection/combined_wu_tsi_to_sheets_using_parallel.py` to `/archive/combined_wu_tsi_to_sheets_using_parallel.py`

2. **Completed Project Management Files**:
   - ✅ Moved `/toDo` to `/archive/toDo` (all tasks were marked as complete)
   - ✅ Moved `/reorganize_project.py` to `/archive/reorganize_project.py` (reorganization complete)

3. **Old Data Collection Scripts**:
   - ✅ Moved `/oldPulls/old_wu_datapull.py` to `/archive/deprecated_scripts/old_wu_datapull.py`
   - ✅ Moved `/oldPulls/oldtsi_datapull.py` to `/archive/deprecated_scripts/oldtsi_datapull.py`
   - ✅ Moved `/scripts/tsi_streamlit_gui_with_preview.py` to `/archive/deprecated_scripts/tsi_streamlit_gui_with_preview.py` (superseded by enhanced GUI)
   - ✅ Moved `/scripts/tsi_to_google_sheets.py` to `/archive/deprecated_scripts/tsi_to_google_sheets.py` (command-line script called by old GUI)

4. **Duplicate Logs**:
   - ✅ Moved `/data/data_management.log` to `/archive/data_management_partial_20250525.log` (redundant with main log)

### Removed Files and Directories
The following items were completely removed:

1. **Cache Files**:
   - ✅ Removed all `__pycache__/` directories and `.pyc` files throughout the project
   - ✅ Removed `.ipynb_checkpoints/` directory

2. **Empty Directories**:
   - ✅ Removed `/oldPulls/` directory (after moving its contents)
   - ✅ Removed `/scripts/` directory (after moving its contents)
   - ✅ Removed `/temp/` directory (empty)

3. **System Files**:
   - ✅ Removed `.DS_Store` macOS system file

### Optimized Backups
The following optimizations were made to the backup system:

1. **Configuration Backups**:
   - ✅ Kept only the 3 most recent configuration backups (from May 25, 2025)
   - ✅ Removed 7 older configuration backups from earlier on the same day

## Current Project Structure

### Active Data Collection Systems
The project now uses these primary modules for data collection:

- `/src/data_collection/faster_wu_tsi_to_sheets_async.py` (main data collection)
- `/src/data_collection/automated_data_pull.py` (automated scheduling)
- `/src/data_collection/prioritized_data_pull_manager.py` (priority-based data collection)
- `/src/data_collection/production_data_pull_executor.py` (production execution system)

### Active User Interface
- `/src/gui/enhanced_streamlit_gui.py` (comprehensive GUI interface)

### Organized Archive
- `/archive/deprecated_scripts/` (contains old superseded scripts)
- `/archive/` (contains other historical project files)

## Next Steps

1. **Consider updating the Python environment**:
   - The `install_and_verify.sh` script encountered an error related to the Python environment
   - This was not caused by our cleanup but may need attention

2. **Implement regular automated cleanup**:
   - Consider setting up automatic cleanup of configuration backups using:
   ```bash
   python -c "from src.core.backup_system import BackupSystem; BackupSystem().cleanup_old_backups(days_to_keep=7)"
   ```

3. **Review space usage periodically**:
   - Monitor the growth of log files, especially `data_management.log` (314KB currently)
   - Consider implementing log rotation if logs grow too large

## Project Status

The project is now significantly cleaner with outdated and duplicate files properly archived. All necessary project functionality has been preserved, and the codebase is more manageable with a clearer structure.
