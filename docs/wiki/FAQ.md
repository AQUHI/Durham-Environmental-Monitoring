## Troubleshooting

### Q: The dashboard shows "No data available" - what should I do?
**A:** Check the following:
1. Verify internet connection
2. Check API credentials in configuration
3. Review logs for error messages
4. Ensure data sources are accessible
5. Check date range settings

### Q: API calls are failing with authentication errors
**A:** Common solutions:
1. Verify API keys are correct and active
2. Check rate limiting (APIs may have usage limits)
3. Ensure proper credential storage
4. Review API documentation for changes

### Q: The system is running slowly
**A:** Performance optimization steps:
1. Check available system resources
2. Review database performance
3. Optimize data query ranges
