        # add local download as an option, see if it can go to onedrive as well
        # try onedrive // for space
        # shortcut teams
future goal:    upload automatically to a folder,
check old code for route
one folder dedicated to raw data pull (weekly or biweekly for both)
one automatically updated folder (to never lose data each week 90 day thing)
52 files in a year for one
another one with the whole year's data in one sheet (keeps getting updated)
check wu's max pull, tsi is 15 mins
pull every week
inside data is very important to pull

analyzing data:
    see why it decreases

visualization
plot with each device
different categories on same plot (try at least 2 data categories)

for gmail: put into folder (hotdurham)

organizing lab and playing with sensors next week

future:
for someone (pub or with access) to request data themselves
maybe with server
maybe credentials stay local (so they don't need it)
