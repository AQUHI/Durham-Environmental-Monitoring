# Data Pull & Storage
local download as an option, see if it can go to onedrive as well
future goal: upload automatically to a folder
check old code for route
one folder dedicated to raw data pull (weekly or biweekly for both)
one automatically updated folder (to never lose data each week, to bypass 90 day expiration)
52 files in a year for one
another one with the whole year's data in one sheet (keeps getting updated)
check wu's max pull, tsi is 15 mins
pull every week
inside data is very important to pull often

# Analysis & Visualization
analyzing data:
    see why it decreases
visualization
plot with each device
different categories on same plot (try at least 2 data categories)

# Collaboration & Automation
shortcut teams
organizing lab and playing with sensors next week

# Future/Advanced
for someone (pub or with access) to request data themselves
maybe with server
maybe credentials stay local (so they don't need it)



fix the options, if i say only wu then the code does not work the same
