# Hot Durham Project: To-Do List

## I. Data Pull & Storage

### A. Local & Cloud Storage Options
- [ ] Implement local download as an option for pulled data.
- [ ] Investigate and implement OneDrive upload functionality for local downloads.
    - Future Goal: Automate uploads to a specific OneDrive folder.
    - Check old code for existing routes/logic for cloud uploads.

### B. Data Organization & Retention
- [ ] Designate a dedicated folder for raw data pulls (consider weekly or bi-weekly pulls for both WU and TSI).
- [ ] Create an automatically updated folder/system to prevent data loss due to the 90-day expiration limit (especially for TSI).
    - This ensures a continuous archive of all sensor readings.
- [ ] Maintain 52 individual weekly data files for each year (one file per week).
- [ ] Create a consolidated sheet/file containing the entire year's data, which is continuously updated.

### C. Data Pull Frequency & Limits
- [ ] Confirm Weather Underground's maximum data pull limits and frequency.
    - Note: TSI's limit is data every 15 minutes.
- [ ] Establish a regular data pull schedule (e.g., weekly) to ensure timely data collection.
- [ ] Prioritize frequent pulls for "inside data" (if this refers to specific indoor sensors or critical data points).

## II. Data Analysis & Visualization

### A. Data Analysis
- [ ] Investigate reasons for any observed decreases or anomalies in sensor data.
    - Perform trend analysis.
    - Correlate with external events if possible.

### B. Data Visualization
- [ ] Create plots/charts for each individual device/sensor.
- [ ] Develop visualizations that combine multiple data categories on the same plot.
    - Aim for at least two different data categories (e.g., PM2.5 and Temperature) on a single chart for comparison.
- [ ] Ensure device names are clearly visible in chart legends for easy identification.

## III. Script & Application Enhancements

- [ ] Review and refactor existing scripts for clarity, efficiency, and error handling.
- [ ] Enhance the Streamlit GUI (`tsi_streamlit_gui_with_preview.py`):
    - [ ] Add support for Weather Underground data.
    - [ ] Improve live preview capabilities.
- [ ] Update and maintain `requirements.txt` and `README.md` as the project evolves.

## IV. General Tasks & Reminders

- [ ] Regularly back up credential files and critical data.
- [ ] Document any new features or changes to the workflow.
- [ ] Address any items noted in the `toDo` file (meta-task!).
