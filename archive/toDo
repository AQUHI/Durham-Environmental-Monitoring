# Hot Durham Project: To-Do List

## I. Data Pull & Storage

### A. Local & Cloud Storage Options
- [x] Implement local download as an option for pulled data.
- [x] Investigate and implement OneDrive upload functionality for local downloads.
    - Future Goal: Automate uploads to a specific OneDrive folder.
    - Check old code for existing routes/logic for cloud uploads.

### B. Data Organization & Retention
- [x] Designate a dedicated folder for raw data pulls (consider weekly or bi-weekly pulls for both WU and TSI).
- [x] Create an automatically updated folder/system to prevent data loss due to the 90-day expiration limit (especially for TSI).
    - This ensures a continuous archive of all sensor readings.
- [x] Maintain 52 individual weekly data files for each year (one file per week).
- [x] Create a consolidated sheet/file containing the entire year's data, which is continuously updated.

### C. Data Pull Frequency & Limits
- [x] Confirm Weather Underground's maximum data pull limits and frequency.
    - Note: TSI's limit is data every 15 minutes.
- [x] Establish a regular data pull schedule (e.g., weekly) to ensure timely data collection.
- [x] Prioritize frequent pulls for "inside data" (if this refers to specific indoor sensors or critical data points).
- [x] Implement production data pull execution system with intelligent scheduling.
    - [x] Created `production_data_pull_executor.py` for actual data collection
    - [x] Integrated prioritized scheduling with existing data management
    - [x] Added execution status monitoring and gap recovery capabilities

## II. Data Analysis & Visualization

### A. Data Analysis
- [x] Investigate reasons for any observed decreases or anomalies in sensor data.
    - Perform trend analysis.
    - Correlate with external events if possible.

### B. Data Visualization
- [x] Create plots/charts for each individual device/sensor.
- [x] Develop visualizations that combine multiple data categories on the same plot.
    - Aim for at least two different data categories (e.g., PM2.5 and Temperature) on a single chart for comparison.
- [x] Ensure device names are clearly visible in chart legends for easy identification.

## III. Script & Application Enhancements

- [x] Review and refactor existing scripts for clarity, efficiency, and error handling.
- [x] Enhance the Streamlit GUI (`tsi_streamlit_gui_with_preview.py`):
    - [x] Add support for Weather Underground data.
    - [x] Improve live preview capabilities.
- [x] Update and maintain `requirements.txt` and `README.md` as the project evolves.

## IV. General Tasks & Reminders

- [x] Regularly back up credential files and critical data.
    - [x] Implemented comprehensive backup system (`backup_system.py`)
    - [x] Added automated credential backup with encryption option
    - [x] Created critical data archiving with configurable retention
    - [x] Integrated Google Drive backup sync for disaster recovery
- [x] Document any new features or changes to the workflow.
    - [x] Created comprehensive documentation (`NEW_FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
    - [x] Documented anomaly detection and trend analysis system
    - [x] Documented prioritized data pull manager
    - [x] Documented backup system and usage examples
    - [x] Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies
- [x] Address any items noted in the `toDo` file (meta-task!).

## V. FINAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS âœ…

**ALL MAJOR TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!** 

### Recently Completed (May 25, 2025):

- Production-ready deployment capabilities
- Complete integration testing framework

The system is fully operational and ready for real-world air quality monitoring and analysis.


Potential Applications:

Air Quality Alerts: Automated notifications when PM2.5 exceeds healthy levels
Heat Island Analysis: Study temperature variations across Durham neighborhoods
Seasonal Patterns: Track how air quality changes throughout the year
Community Reports: Generate monthly environmental health reports
Public Dashboard: Share real-time data with Durham residents
