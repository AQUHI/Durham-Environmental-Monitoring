Google Drive Sharing Restoration Script

This script helps restore sharing permissions for files that were uploaded by your
service account but are no longer visible to hotdurham@gmail.com. It will:

1. List all files owned by the service account
2. Re-share them with hotdurham@gmail.com
3. Provide a summary of what was shared

Usage:
    python tools/restore_drive_sharing.py
